The paper develops a mathematical criterion to balance environmental factors (as land price), service radius of a station (i.e. how much the battery gets discharged to get to a station), investment, maintenance, and operation costs. The constraints limit infrastructure properties as how many stations can be connected to one power supply. The objective (formula (3)) is then minimized using standard optimization techniques - a *dual formulation* is calculated and this dual is optimized using the *Newton's method*.

Relevant quote:
* EVs cannot only increase energy utilization andreduce pollution emission, but also smooth the load curve bypeak load shaving and, hence, enhance the security and eco-nomics of the power system concerned by coordinating with intermittent renewable energies, such as wind generation.

This paper proposes a formal definition of the problem (Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement Problem). In the paper, it is proven that the problem is NP-complete by a reduction from the *Vertex Cover Problem*. The city is represented as a graph with a distance metric, where each car has a maximum reachable distance, the capacity of a station is more than the average demand in the neighborhood of this station (estimated from density!). The problem is then solved using the *Mixed Integer Programming*, and a *greedy heuristics* is provided.

Relevant qote:
* We  study  where  charging  stationsshould be constructed in a city such that we can minimize theconstruction cost with coverage extended to the whole city andfulfillment of driversâ€™ convenience.
* hundreds of EVs coordinateto  act  as  a  power  source  selling  power  back  to  the  grid  orto  support  auxiliary  services  like  regulation.
* We concernmore about how EVs influence the growth of a smart city.
