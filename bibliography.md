The paper develops a mathematical criterion to balance environmental factors (as land price), service radius of a station (i.e. how much the battery gets discharged to get to a station), investment, maintenance, and operation costs. The constraints limit infrastructure properties as how many stations can be connected to one power supply. The objective (formula (3)) is then minimized using standard optimization techniques - a dual formulation is calculated and this dual is optimized using the Newton's method.

Relevant quote:
* EVs cannot only increase energy utilization andreduce pollution emission, but also smooth the load curve bypeak load shaving and, hence, enhance the security and eco-nomics of the power system concerned by coordinating with intermittent renewable energies, such as wind generation.

Uses a GA to optimise the distribution of charging stations. Objective function contains two objectives to be minimised: 1) Cost of constructing the charging stations; 2) Cost for drivers to reach their nearest charging station. Candidate solutions are encoded as bit strings: There are ten possible station locations, and five of these are chosen for each individual. For our project, we do not consider the cost of construction of the stations.
