	abstract={With the progressive exhaustion of fossil energy and the enhanced awareness of environmental protection, more attention is being paid to electric vehicles (EVs). Inappropriate siting and sizing of EV charging stations could have negative effects on the development of EVs, the layout of the city traffic network, and the convenience of EVs' drivers, and lead to an increase in network losses and a degradation in voltage profiles at some nodes. Given this background, the optimal sites of EV charging stations are first identified by a two-step screening method with environmental factors and service radius of EV charging stations considered. Then, a mathematical model for the optimal sizing of EV charging stations is developed with the minimization of total cost associated with EV charging stations to be planned as the objective function and solved by a modified primal-dual interior point algorithm (MPDIPA). Finally, simulation results of the IEEE 123-node test feeder have demonstrated that the developed model and method cannot only attain the reasonable planning scheme of EV charging stations, but also reduce the network loss and improve the voltage profile.},

	abstract={Transportation electrification is one of the essential components in the future smart city planning and electric vehicles (EVs) will be integrated into the transportation system seamlessly. Charging stations are the main source of energy for EVs and their locations are critical to the accessibility of EVs in a city. They should be carefully situated so that an EV can access a charging station within its driving range and cruise around anywhere in the city upon being recharged. In this paper, we formulate the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement Problem, in which we minimize the total construction cost subject to the constraints for the charging station coverage and the convenience of the drivers for EV charging. We study the properties of the problem, especially its NP-hardness, and propose an efficient greedy algorithm to tackle the problem. We perform a series of simulation whose results show that the greedy algorithm can result in solutions comparable to the mixed-integer programming approach and its computation time is much shorter.},

	abstract={Due to environmental issues, electric mobility is one of the mobility alternatives that are receiving a huge attention nowadays. In fact, in the last few years electric vehicles have entered the world's car market. This revolutionary technology requires a fast deployment of electric charging stations since the key issue in this system is recharging the batteries. In this work, we propose an optimized algorithm to locate electric-vehicles charging stations. Different factors and limitations are considered and a real case study is given as an application. We first determine the appropriate strict constraints and cost of charging stations' location; and then we propose a mathematical formulation of the problem before solving it using our optimized algorithm named OLoCs (Optimized Location Scheme for electric charging stations). This latter is a heuristic solution; in which we adapt a genetic algorithm to solve the charging stations' location problem. We add a new operator to the classical genetic algorithm to prevent premature convergence and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. OLoCs determines the necessary number of charging stations and their best opening placement. Finally, we evaluate OLoCs performances by analyzing its convergence time and depicting the graphic placement results on a studied map.},

	abstract = "This paper develops a novel solution to integrate electric vehicles and optimally determine the siting and sizing of charging stations (CSs), considering the interactions between power and transportation industries. Firstly, the originâ€“destination (OD) traffic flow data is optimally assigned to the transportation network, which is then utilized to determine the capacity of charging stations. Secondly, the charging demand of charging infrastructures is integrated into a cost-based model to evaluate the economics of candidate plans. Furthermore, load capability constraints are proposed to evaluate whether the candidate CSs deployment and tie line plans could be adopted. Different scenarios generated by load profile templates are innovatively integrated into the economic planning model to deal with uncertain operational states. The models and framework are demonstrated and verified by a test case, which offers a perspective for effectively realizing optimal planning of the CSs considering the constraints from both transportation and distribution networks."
